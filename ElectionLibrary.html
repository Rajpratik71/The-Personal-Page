            <p>During the 2016 presidential election, America’s election infrastructure was targeted by actors sponsored by the Russian government. Securing the Vote: Protecting American Democracy examines the challenges arising out of the 2016 federal election, assesses current technology and standards for voting, and recommends steps that the federal government, state and local governments, election administrators, and vendors of voting technology should take to improve the security of election infrastructure. In doing so, the report provides a vision of voting that is more secure, accessible, reliable, and verifiable.

<p>Election Buster is an open source tool created in 2014 to identify malicious domains masquerading as candidate webpages and voter registration systems. During 2016, fake domains were used to compromise credentials of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) IT services company, and foreign adversaries probed voter registration systems. The tool now cross-checks domain information against open source threat intelligence feeds, and uses a semi-autonomous scheme for identifying phundraising and false flag sites via ensembled data mining and deep learning techniques. We identified Russian nationals registering fake campaign sites, candidates deploying defensive—and offensive—measures against their opponents, and candidates unintentionally exposing sensitive PII to the public. This talk provides an analysis of our 2016 Presidential Election data, and all data recently collected during the 2018 midterm elections. The talk also details technological and procedural measures that government offices and campaigns can use to defend themselves</p>

<h4>Authors: <i>Joshua M Franklin, Kevin Franklin</i></h4>		
<p> Electoral candidates from both sides of the aisle increasingly rely on the internet to promote their brands and to focus the message of their political platforms. Yet cyberspace isn’t safespace. How do voters know they’re viewing a candidate’s real website? How can voters ensure their online donations are actually going to a specific candidate or cause? Election cybercrime is a burgeoning area but little data exists on the size and scope of these unscrupulous activities. We wrote our own open source suite of tools to begin to measure the scope of this problem and used it to scan every single candidate running for the house and senate (1000+ candidates)in the 2014 General Elections. In this session we’ll discuss the results of our scans and explore how any candidates and voters can defend themselves online.</p>

<p> This presentation looks back at the number of ways that the 2012 Presidential election was bought, sold, and manipulated through malicious online activities. We identify activities that could be classified as manipulative, mischievous, or downright illegal, such as fake campaign donation sites, political spam, attempts to sell ballots, privacy violations, and rogue Super PACs. For each of these activities we provide examples of sources that demonstrate their online presence during the 2012 election and include additional information. We also include examples of malicious election activity in recent elections. Finally, we attempt to examine and discuss the motivations and methods behind these malicious activities.

            <p>In 2010, Washington, D.C. developed an Internet voting pilot
project that was intended to allow overseas absentee voters to cast their
ballots using a website. Prior to deploying the system in the general
election, the District held a unique public trial: a mock election during
which anyone was invited to test the system or attempt to compromise
its security. This paper describes our experience participating in this
trial. Within 48 hours of the system going live, we had gained nearcomplete
control of the election server. We successfully changed every vote
and revealed almost every secret ballot. Election officials did not detect
our intrusion for nearly two business days— and might have remained
unaware for far longer had we not deliberately left a prominent clue. This
case study— the first (to our knowledge) to analyze the security of a
government Internet voting system from the perspective of an attacker in
a realistic pre-election deployment— attempts to illuminate the practical
challenges of securing online voting as practiced today by a growing
number of jurisdictions</p>

<h4>State Certification Testing of Voting Systems National Conference, June 2012   (<a href="/prez/EvotingCertificationProtocol.pdf">Slides</a>)</h4>
<h4>Authors: <i>Dr. Jay Bagga, Jessica Myers, Joshua M Franklin</i></h4>
<p>The certification of voting systems is both an art and a science, drawing from a variety of scientific fields while requiring astute political and sociological knowledge. This work attempts to abstract from all the layers and complexities of voting system certification and propose a protocol to be used a guide when certifying voting systems. It represents current best practices, and incorporates ideas from both the federal and state certification programs. Although the protocol is generalized, it is intended to be extremely practical.

This work applies to certification at all levels in the United States, including federal, state, and local. It attempts to aggregate best practices and knowledge of certification processes at these levels to produce a certification protocol that can be continually revised. In the author's opinion, the certification authority granting or denying certification possibly plays the largest role in the certification process, in that the skill, personnel, and resources of that entity are used to assess a voting system against the certification requirements. As a best practice the certification authority should work closely with the local election officials running elections, and incorporate this perspective into the certification process.</p>

<p>We describe the first systematic, quantitative threat
evaluation in a local election jurisdiction in the U.S.,
Marin County, California, in the November 2010 general
election. We made use of a reusable threat model
that we have developed over several years. The threat
model is based on attack trees with several novel enhancements
to promote model reuse and flexible metrics,
implemented in a software tool, AttackDog. We
assess the practicality of reusable threat models for local
elections offices and analyze specific vulnerabilities
in Marin County, using as our metric “attack team
size” (ATS) – the number of individuals who are knowingly
involved in election fraud.

in Voting Systems</h4>

        <h4>Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences, 2008 (<a href="https://jfranklin.me/ElectionLibrary/OnTheNotionOfSoftwareIndependenceInVotingSystems.pdf">Paper</a>)</h4>
        <h4>Authors: <i>Ronald L. Rivest, John P. Wack</i></h4>
            <p>This paper defines and explores the notion of “software-independence” in voting
systems:
<i>A voting system is software-independent if an undetected change or
error in its software cannot cause an undetectable change or error in an
election outcome.</i>
For example, optical scan and some cryptographically-based voting systems are
software-independent. Variations and implications of this definition are explored. We propose that software-independent voting systems should be preferred, and
software-dependent voting systems should be avoided.
An initial version of this paper was prepared for use by the Technical Guidelines
Development Committee (TGDC) in their development of the Voluntary Voting
System Guidelines (VVSG), which will specify the requirements that U.S. voting
systems must meet to receive certification.</p>

        <h4>Authors: <i>Tadayoshi Kohno, Adam Stubblefield, Aviel D. Rubin, Dan S. Wallach</i></h4>
            <p>With significant U.S. federal funds now available to replace outdated punch-card and mechanical
voting systems, municipalities and states throughout the U.S. are adopting paperless electronic voting
systems from a number of different vendors. We present a security analysis of the source code to one such
machine used in a significant share of the market. Our analysis shows that this voting system is far below
even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts. We identify several problems
including unauthorized privilege escalation, incorrect use of cryptography, vulnerabilities to network
threats, and poor software development processes. We show that voters, without any insider privileges,
can cast unlimited votes without being detected by any mechanisms within the voting terminal software.
Furthermore, we show that even the most serious of our outsider attacks could have been discovered
and executed without access to the source code. In the face of such attacks, the usual worries about
insider threats are not the only concerns; outsiders can do the damage. That said, we demonstrate that
the insider threat is also quite considerable, showing that not only can an insider, such as a poll worker,
modify the votes, but that insiders can also violate voter privacy and match votes with the voters who
cast them. We conclude that this voting system is unsuitable for use in a general election. Any paperless
electronic voting system might suffer similar flaws, despite any “certification” it could have otherwise
received. We suggest that the best solutions are voting systems having a “voter-verifiable audit trail,”
where a computerized voting system might print a paper ballot that can be read and verified by the voter
