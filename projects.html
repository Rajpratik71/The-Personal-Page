<p>Election Buster is an open source tool created in 2014 to identify malicious domains masquerading as candidate webpages and voter registration systems. During 2016, fake domains were used to compromise credentials of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) IT services company, and foreign adversaries probed voter registration systems. The tool now cross-checks domain information against open source threat intelligence feeds, and uses a semi-autonomous scheme for identifying phundraising and false flag sites via ensembled data mining and deep learning techniques. We identified Russian nationals registering fake campaign sites, candidates deploying defensive—and offensive—measures against their opponents, and candidates unintentionally exposing sensitive PII to the public. This talk provides an analysis of our 2016 Presidential Election data, and all data recently collected during the 2018 midterm elections. The talk also details technological and procedural measures that government offices and campaigns can use to defend themselves</p>

NCCoE's mobile security efforts are dedicated to solving enterprise mobile security challenges. In talking with mobile security stakeholders, we realized there was a need for a comprehensive catalog of threats posed to mobile devices. The resulting Catalogue outlines a taxonomy of threats, including those faced by a mobile device itself as well as the broader mobile ecosystem upon which the device depends. Each Catalogue entry includes a title, exploit examples, countermeasures, and references. The Catalogue resides on GitHub, enabling public collaboration and continuous development. </p>

<p>The NPSBN will enable first responders to use modern mobile devices for interoperable public safety operations. While this fundamentally changes how first responders will communicate and access public safety resources, the mobile devices and the data and applications residing on the devices, need to be secured against mobile malware and other threats. Protection mechanisms will need to include methods to isolate commercial applications from mission critical ones, while providing management and reporting capabilities to determine if a device is compromised.

<p> There is a need for cybersecurity capabilities and features to protect the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). However, cybersecurity requirements should not compromise the ability of first responders to complete their missions. In addition, the diversity of public safety disciplines means that one solution may not meet the usability needs of different disciplines. Understanding how public safety users operate in their different environments will allow for usable cybersecurity capabilities and features to be deployed and used. Although first responders work in a variety of disciplines, this report is focused on fire service, emergency medical, and law enforcement. This report describes the constraints presented by the personal protective equipment, specialized gear, and unique operating environments and how such92 constraints may interact with mobile authentication requirements. The overarching goal of this work is analyzing mobile authentication technologies to explore which may be more appropriate and usable for first responders in a given environment.</p>

<p> Electoral candidates from both sides of the aisle increasingly rely on the internet to promote their brands and to focus the message of their political platforms. Yet cyberspace isn’t safespace. How do voters know they’re viewing a candidate’s real website? How can voters ensure their online donations are actually going to a specific candidate or cause? Election cybercrime is a burgeoning area but little data exists on the size and scope of these unscrupulous activities. We wrote our own open source suite of tools to begin to measure the scope of this problem and used it to scan every single candidate running for the house and senate (1000+ candidates)in the 2014 General Elections. In this session we’ll discuss the results of our scans and explore how any candidates and voters can defend themselves online.</p>

<p>Password entry on mobile devices significantly impacts both usability and security, but there is a dearth of usable security research in this area, specifically for complex password entry. To address this research gap, we set out to assign strength metrics to passwords for which we already had usability data, in an effort to have a more meaningful comparison between usability and security. A primary accomplishment of this work is our method of optimizing the input of randomly generated passwords on mobile devices via password permutation. This is done by grouping character classes (i.e., uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol) together to minimize the total number of required keystrokes and decrease cognitive load. We propose a measurement method for quantifying effects on entropy resulting from this password permutation. Additionally, we created and are releasing python scripts, and make use of an existing publicly available NIST data visualization tool to facilitate comparison between usability and security metrics.</p>

<p> This Interagency Report provides guidance to individuals scoring vulnerabilities using the Common 
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.0 scoring metrics. CVSS defines a vulnerability as a 
bug, flaw, weakness, or exposure of an application, system device, or service that could lead to a failure of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The guidance in this document is the result of applying the CVSS specification to over 50 000 vulnerabilities scored by analysts at the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This document is intended to serve as an extension to the CVSS Version 2.0 specification, providing additional guidance for difficult and/or unique scoring situations. To assist vulnerability analysts, common keywords and phrases are identified and accompanied by suggested scores for particular types of software vulnerabilities. The report includes a collection of scored vulnerabilities from the NVD, alongside a justification for the provided score. Finally, this report contains a description of the NVD’s vulnerability scoring process. </p>

<p> This presentation looks back at the number of ways that the 2012 Presidential election was bought, sold, and manipulated through malicious online activities. We identify activities that could be classified as manipulative, mischievous, or downright illegal, such as fake campaign donation sites, political spam, attempts to sell ballots, privacy violations, and rogue Super PACs. For each of these activities we provide examples of sources that demonstrate their online presence during the 2012 election and include additional information. We also include examples of malicious election activity in recent elections. Finally, we attempt to examine and discuss the motivations and methods behind these malicious activities.

<h4>Co-authors: <i>Dr. Jay Bagga, Jessica Myers</i></h4>
<p>The certification of voting systems is both an art and a science, drawing from a variety of scientific fields while requiring astute political and sociological knowledge. This work attempts to abstract from all the layers and complexities of voting system certification and propose a protocol to be used a guide when certifying voting systems. It represents current best practices, and incorporates ideas from both the federal and state certification programs. Although the protocol is generalized, it is intended to be extremely practical.

This work applies to certification at all levels in the United States, including federal, state, and local. It attempts to aggregate best practices and knowledge of certification processes at these levels to produce a certification protocol that can be continually revised. In the author's opinion, the certification authority granting or denying certification possibly plays the largest role in the certification process, in that the skill, personnel, and resources of that entity are used to assess a voting system against the certification requirements. As a best practice the certification authority should work closely with the local election officials running elections, and incorporate this perspective into the certification process.</p>
