<p>Lucas Benedičič was born on December 12, 1977 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After enrolling as a grade student at the <a href="http://www.uba.ar/ingles/index02.php">University of Buenos Aires</a>, he attended and completed the first 4 years of the undergraduate programme in computer sciences at the <a href="http://exactas.uba.ar/">Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>After moving to Slovenia in 2002, he enrolled the <a href="http://www.uni-lj.si/en/">University of Ljubljana</a>, <a href="http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/">Faculty of Computer and Information Science</a>, where he graduated in 2007 with the work titled »Application development using open-source technologies«.</p>
<p>In September 2007, he started his postgraduate studies at the <a href="http://www.upr.si/index.php?lang=eng">University of Primorska</a>, <a href="http://www.famnit.upr.si/en">Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies</a>, after enrolling the Masters' study programme for computer sciences. He graduated in 2009 with the work titled »Optimization of Common Pilot Channels in UMTS Networks«.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2007, he was awarded a scholarship for continuing postgraduate studies in Slovenia. The award was received after winning an open contest of problem solving, organized by <a href="http://www.halcom.si">Halcom, d.d.</a></p>
<p>In fall 2009, he enrolled in the PhD program entitled “Information and Communication Technologies” under the supervision of Assistant Professor Peter Korošec, at the <a href="http://www.mps.si/splet/index.asp?lang=eng">Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p>
<p>In November 2009 he became a junior researcher from industry, funded by the European Union through the European Social Fund. During this period he is holding working positions at <a href="http://www.telekom.si">Telekom Slovenije, d.d.</a>, in research and development within the Radio Network Department, and at the <a href="http://www.ijs.si/ijsw/JSI">Jožef Stefan Institute</a>, in the Computer Systems Department.</p>
<p>In 2011 he attended and successfully completed the summer institute »Scientific Computing in the Americas: the challenge of massive parallelism«, organized by the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/pasi/">Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute</a>, Boston University. The focus of the institute was on advanced topics of theory and programming of massively parallel processors.</p>
<p>In early 2012, he received an invitation to work as a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://nacc.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/">Nagasaki Advanced Computer Center (NACC)</a> at the University of Nagasaki, Japan. His joint research work at NACC is to be completed by the end of 2012.</p>
<p>His research interests include combinatorial and numerical optimization, mostly applied to optimization problems in the area of 3G radio networks, metaheuristic algorithms, parallel and GPU computing. Over the last few years, he has presented his research work at several international conferences and workshops in the areas of evolutionary computation, optimization and parallel computing.</p>
